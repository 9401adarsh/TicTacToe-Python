# TicTacToe-Python

This simple project consists of two simple AI models based on zero-sum games. The game in focus here is a tic-tac-toe.

The two different models that have been used for the tic-tac-toe AI, that can be played on the terminal are:
i) Minimax Algorithm
ii) A Reinforcement Learning Model ( Q-Value Updation )

The project has been completely done on Python.

The tic-tac-toe.py File, is a simple two Human player interface of the game that can be played on the terminal.
The tic-tac-toe-ai.py File, (the one outside the Reinforcement Folder) is the file wherein the minimax algorithm has been used.
The tic-tac-toe-ai.py File, inside the reinforcement folder, is the file where a Q-value updation model has been used.
